[About Me](#about-me)

## About Me
My name is Yolanda Mussana and I am a data analyst. I recently completed my degree in Computer Sciences at Eduvos, a private institution in South Africa. I hold skills in data analytics, web development, python, c++ and AI. I love exploring the different aspects of Data Science.

# MY PORFOLIO
## PROJECT 1: South Africa's top 5 YouTube channels.


### Objective 

- What is the key pain point? 

The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.


- What is the ideal solution? 

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top SA YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- subscriber count
- total views
- total videos, and
- engagement metrics

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

# User story 

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in South Africa . 

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views. 

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.


# Data source 

- What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need data on the top SA YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded



- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)
